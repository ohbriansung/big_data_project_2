#### [1 pt] Choose a day of significance to you (e.g., your birthday), and retrieve a 5% sample of the comments posted on this particular day across all 5 years of the dataset.
#### [1 pt] The number of comments posted per year will likely trend upward over time as more users join Reddit. Use feature scaling to normalize the number of comments per month from 0.0 to 1.0 and plot the values for each year. This way, we can isolate the proportion of comments across months. Do you notice any patterns?


The project specification defines several questions that you will answer with MapReduce jobs. You should edit this document (README.md) with your answers as you find them, including figures, references, etc.
